# Go-Port
 This tool is designed to help you scan all ports, a fixed port, and known ports.
There are 3 options available in this vehicle. The first one asks you for an address, if you want this address, http and https or when you enter it correctly with only the domain name without using both, it will scan all the ports for you and return an answer to you when it finds only the open ones.<br><br>The second option will again receive one address from you. In addition to the address it receives, it also asks for the number of the port you want to know if it is open. In contrast to the first option, in this option, if the port is closed, it returns the message "port closed", if the port is open, it returns to you, each time it asks you a small question about what you do not want to continue, you can make this choice with the letters "y" or "n".<br><br>The last option is to take one address from you and try to connect to this address from the most known ports, returning a feedback to you. In the first option and in the last option, if the ports are closed, no result returns, only the open ports.
